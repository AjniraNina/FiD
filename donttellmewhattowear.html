    <p><strong>First time I was slut shamed was when I was 10 years old.</strong></p>

    <p> I was eating my ice cream in a mini skirt and rolled in my roller skates down the street. My peers were attending a religious class. I too, usually would join them, but this particular Sunday I just didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
    
    
    <p> Later that day I was told that our teacher announced to our class that I will burn in hell for wearing a short skirt. Everybody nodded.</p>
    
    <p> How dramatic I thought.</p>
    
    <p> Fast forward to today and I still think the same.</p>
    
    <p> Isn&rsquo;t that peculiar; a short skirt will transport you to hell, and an old man will get a free pass for sexualizing a child?</p>
    
    <p> I am not the first human to be shamed for wearing &ldquo;daring&rdquo; clothing. My teacher is not the first man to try to normalize slut shaming.</p>
    
    <p> We are denied school, work and friendships when we wear &lsquo;distracting clothing&rsquo;. People threaten, scream and attack all under the demise of &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s best for you&rdquo;.</p>
    
    <h2> Slut Shaming In Society</h2>
    
    <p> There was an open letter written in 2017 by a woman to all women.</p>
    
    <p> A journalist pleaded with women to stop wearing unicorn shirts. She threatened that it&rsquo;s antifeminist to wear unicorns. She claimed that no self respecting adult would infantilize themselves like that.</p>
    
    <p> It&rsquo;s ironic that she used Amelia Earhart, a famous pilot from the 1800s to support her arguments - Amelia was notorious for wearing pants. In the 1800&rsquo;s pants-wearing women were considered silly, often imprisoned and absolutely disrespectful.</p>
    
    <p> Logic in this open letter made no sense and slut-shaming was palpable. Logic rarely accompanies slut-shaming.</p>
    
    <p> A few months back, a woman complained to Reddit about her friend ruining a party. She was offended that a 20-something old girl would wear Marvel inspired clothes and disrespect her all grown-up party. A woman on Reddit wondered if she overreacted...</p>
    
    <p> Reddit&rsquo;s upvotes concluded that she did.</p>
    
    <p> In Cambodia a woman was charged with pornograhy for wearing sexy clothing. In Turkey a woman was slapped by a pedestrian, in Iran women are not allowed to go anywhere without scarves. World is yet to figure out the best way to react.</p>
    
    <p> Slut shaming comes in many ways but the message is always the same: &ldquo;be good to us, easy on our eyes, not too easy, look friendly, not too friendly&rdquo;.</p>
    
    <p> It&rsquo;s misogynistic to say the least. It comes from a human urge to control reality, and it&rsquo;s often justified as a measure of protection. But, is slut shaming an altruistic act or is there more to it? </p>
    
    <p>Actually, science shows that humans shaming humans has more to do with biology and less with the altruistic instincts.</p>
    
    <h2> Processing Slut Shaming</h2>
    
    <p> Our body is wired for survival. The brain needs to be confident that you will stay safe and survive. It doesn't care how you go about it.</p>
    
    <p> To be confident all you need is to raise levels of your self esteem.</p>
    
    <p> There are many ways to raise your self esteem. One easy way is to be part of a distinctive group. Another is to play down the qualities of your own group.</p>
    
    <p>Part of the brain that deals with self-esteem is connected with the self-knowledge bit of your brain which deals with feelings of motivation and reward.</p>
    
    
    <p>Ergo, brain awards you when you downplay qualities of people around you. To put it simply slut shaming secrets a bunch of happy chemicals in your brain.</p>
    
    <p>  It all happens all in a split of a second. Brain registers something out of the ordinary, gets scared that it might be part of a losing team, and puts you in a fight or flight mode.</p>
    
    <p> This mode might trigger a knee jerk reaction such as shaming a little girl for wearing a short skirt, freaking out over a cartoony shirt, or imprisoning a human being. The knee jerk reaction makes you feel like you are part of a distinctive group. .</p>
    
    <p> Knee jerk reactions are reserved for your knees and have no place in brains. Brain can trick you into believing that slut shaming is good because it creates that &ldquo;phew, I got this&rdquo; feeling.</p>
    
    <p> But, you do &ldquo;got this&rdquo;! People that wear different stuff from you, just wear different stuff. Nobody is getting eaten by a lion because of it.</p>
    
    <p> Long story short; don&rsquo;t tell anyone what to wear!</p>
