    <p>You ever get a feeling that makes you &#8203;so excited &#8203;that you want to scream it to the world?</p>

    <p>No, fuck &ldquo;want&rdquo;; &#8203;you &#8203;need &#8203;to tell the world.</p>
    
    <p>You &#8203;need &#8203;to grab every single person by the shoulders, shake them and magically transfer your brain contents into them?</p>
    
    <p> You know that if you can just somehow get into &#8203;their &#8203;brain what is exactly in &#8203;your &#8203;brain, they would &#8203;get it. &#8203;They would love it, be excited by it and, most importantly, their <strong>lives would be better &#8203;for it.</strong></p>
    





    <div id="meaty">

<h2>Why doesn’t ​everyone ​know about this?</h2>

    <p>I like to think that most people will, at least &#8203;once &#8203;in their lives, have a moment like that.</p>
    
    <p> The Degrees of relative importance may vary, as will the actual contents, of course, but what they all have in common is the ability to create an overwhelming sense of<strong> &ldquo;why doesn&rsquo;t &#8203;everyone &#8203;know about this?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    
    <p>I have been having that moment for some time now, trying to figure out the best way to tell others about it without literally going from person to person, excitedly shaking them and hoping for a telepathic osmosis&#8230;</p>
    
    <p>I worry I won&rsquo;t paint as clear a picture as I could. I worry that people will judge the subject of the portrait by the composition of the painting.</p>
    
    <p>I worry because I don't want anyone to miss out on this game-changing discovery.</p>
    
    <p>But, at the end of the day, all I can do is tell the story and hope that you, my lovely, intelligent, &#8203;patient &#8203;reader will be able to extrapolate from it what you need to.</p>
    
    <p>So here it is; This particular story starts with a little girl that loved to play dressup.</p>
    
    <p>A little girl, being me, used to ferociously dig through the boxes of her mum's old clothes.</p>
    
    <p>I used to build characters and intricate plots with moms rags. Then, excitedly, I would march to school armored with the coolest stories that are yet to climax.</p>
    
    <p>My peers didn&rsquo;t get it. They found me controversial. Tried to bully me into submission. There was always someone &lsquo;kind&rsquo; explaining to me that<em> sneakers don&rsquo;t belong with a dress</em>.</p>
    
    <p>I didn&rsquo;t get my peers. I wore what I wanted and cried myself to sleep.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s tough being able to feel and think a certain way without being able to put words to it. It&rsquo;s even tougher when that certain way is &#8203;genuinely &#8203;significant.</p>
    
    <p>But, without being able to put your finger on it specifically enough to correlate it explicitly to the world, it results in a dissonance that makes you seem out of step with what&rsquo;s going on around you.</p>
    
    <p>That&rsquo;s what happened to me; I was too young to understand all the magic that comes with trying on different characters, finding yourself and breaking the patterns that were set for you. But I felt like I needed that magic in my life.</p>
    
    <h2>Turning Point</h2>
    
    <p>Now, the next part of the story describes a major turning point. Before I tell you about it - I Need to warn you; it involves a movie.</p>
    
    <p>A movie some might love and some may never heard about it. Whatever the case, this movie connected all the missing dots for me.</p>
    
    <p>The Devil Wears Prada is a 2006 comedy-drama starring Meryl Streep as a hyper-capable Anna Wintour-like demanding boss of a leading fashion magazine and Anne Hathaway as the eager, can&rsquo;t-wait-to-prove-herself, new hire. All in all, it&rsquo;s a fun 00&rsquo;s movie.    Somewhere in the midst of movie tropes sits a legendary blue sweater scene that sums up the impact of the fashion industry.   It goes something like this;   Hathaway&rsquo;s character mocks editors for fussing over seemingly identical belts. Streep notices her snickers and then explains to her how trivial Hathaway&rsquo;s mocking is.    She reminds her that the fashion industry is responsible for employing millions of people, fuels human expression and points out how Hathaway&rsquo;s attempts to escape the sartorial influence of fashion are sweet but inconceivable.    The sweater she is wearing was chosen for her, just like the belts are going to trickle down to her wardrobe.</p>
    
    <p>Two things happened to me at the time; first, after seeing Anne&rsquo;s character get dressed down so savagely, I switched my movie-allegiance over to the other side.</p>
    
    <p> Up until that point, you get the sense that Anne is your way into this world, but after your perspective is ripped open by Meryl&rsquo;s monologue, you start to see who you should &#8203;really &#8203;be following.</p>
    
    <p>Secondly, something much more important changed as well; it&rsquo;s as if this new train of thought went deep into my being, tossing aside layers that had been accumulated over the years and expertly flipped a switch.</p>
    
    <p> That feeling that I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on before?</p>
    
    <p>Finger. On.Like a domino effect, the spark went through all the previously ineffable sensations and thoughts and connected them methodically into a network of understanding.</p>
    
    <p>Here&rsquo;s what I understood; I &#8203;wasn&rsquo;t &#8203;into fashion because I was &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; or &ldquo;silly&rdquo;. I felt drawn to it because I sensed power.</p>
    
    <p>The power to express, to understand and most importantly, the power to &#8203;change &#8203;things.</p>
    
    <p>Because it was unexplored, it lacked the social credibility that other similarly powerful topics had. That is the conflict that I had felt until that point; feeling connected to a power that the world around me didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
    
    <h2>Window to your Subconsciousness</h2>
    
    <p>Go to your closet right now and have a look; there&rsquo;s clothing that you used to wear but won't throw away, and that&rsquo;s who you were.</p>
    
    <p>There&rsquo;s clothing that you&rsquo;re not fit for yet or you're saving for specific circumstances, and that&rsquo;s who you want to be.</p>
    
    <p>Then there&rsquo;s the vast and complex interplay between who you want to be and who the world is pushing you to be, and that's the clothing you wear every day.</p>
    
    <p>We spend millions on therapy and books to help us understand ourselves better yet no one thought to ask us how we feel about something we put on every day. Something that is the result of the first few choices we make in the day. Something that is also both our first strategy and line of defense when taking on the outside world.</p>
    
    <p>Once we understand ourselves better, we spend &#8203;billions &#8203;on changing that which we are into that which we want to be. Drugs, behavioural/cognitive exercises, motivational books and courses, meetings and seminars on how to be and how to go get it.</p>
    
    <p>Yet with just opening our wardrobe we could see all the trials and tribulations of our life. We could, with the help of materials, patterns and cuts, break free from a singular perspective of ourselves. We could live life on our own terms.</p>
    
    <h2>Choose Your Own Adventure</h2>
    
    <p>When you live your life on your own terms you step out of the world's spirals that keep you tamed. Your vision becomes 20/20 while everyone else struggles with blurry eyes.</p>
    
    <p>To start &rdquo;&lsquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; kind of life you will need curiosity, compassion and binoculars.    Curiosity to ask yourself hard questions, like why do you keep losing socks?</p>
    
    <p>Compassion to understand and forgive yourself for losing your favorite socks. And, finally, binoculars to observe your brain.</p>
    
    <h2>Fashion Brain</h2>
    
    <p>When you explore your brain you learn that the world in your head is not always a spitting image of reality. Brain just takes all the data it can get, makes a mash of things, automates as much as it can and renders the world in front of your eyes. The world that often violates common sense.</p>
    
    <p>For example; If you are holding a cold glass of water while chatting with a stranger, your brain might confuse the stranger for a glass of water and think that this stranger is a bit cold.</p>
    
    <p>Or, if you sit on a chair with a hard surface you will be more focused, or, if you cross your hands people around you will think that you are not interested in them.</p>
    
    <p>Your brain judges everything. Most judgments it makes are done behind closed doors aka subconsciously, without asking for your input.</p>
    
    <p>Don&rsquo;t accept the roles your brain foists on you. Recreate yourself by having the last word and, finally, be the master of your own life.</p>
    
    <p>Start with paying attention to what your brain thinks you should be wearing. See what roles your autopilot is choosing for you.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy, just ask yourself why you are wearing that outfit?</p>
    
    <p>Write down 10 answers. If you have more time write down 10 answers for each article of clothing you have on you. Be generous with your answers.</p>
    
    <p>Think about sizing, comfort levels, past desires, childhood, friends and what your plans are for your future self. Investigate.   Here is a screenshot of mine:    By digging deep into the why and exploring the tapestry of answers you give yourself; you will notice the patterns you make, life will become clearer and you will see how everything works in synergy. Everything is related to everything else.   It&rsquo;s in this relationship that you can maximize your creative power. Instead of reminding yourself of your insecurities you could be reminding yourself, and the people around you, of who you truly are.</p>
    
    <p>  You get to inhabit the world in a different way. You get to discover the bits of yourself you thought never existed, learn from yourself and remember what life was and what life could be.    All your brain needs is a hint that your opinion matters and it will start helping you plot the best version of your future.</p>
    
    <p> If you dress for your best self anything is possible!</p>
    
    <h2>Power Of Fashion in The World</h2>
    
    <p>Now that you understand what a strong personal power fashion is. You&rsquo;re ready to find out just how insanely powerful it is in the world.</p>
    
    <p>My first clue as to the power of fashion came soon after the DevilPradaTurningPoint</p>
    
    <p>My dad is a simple man, salt of the earth kinda guy; if you asked him what his position in the fashion world is, he would tell you that he&rsquo;s not &#8203;in &#8203;the fashion world. And with the correlations/associations that come with the term &ldquo;fashion world&rdquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him.</p>
    
    <p>He simply picks &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; to throw on and goes on with his day. But the thing is, just by choosing to &ldquo;abstain&rdquo; from fashion choices, he is &#8203;making &#8203;a fashion choice. He is dressing to tell the world that he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s inescapable, to say the least. It permeates every facet of society, from the way we live our lives, communicate with others, all the way to cultural, societal, industrial&#8230;</p>
    
    <p> Scientists have been exploring this phenomena for a while now.</p>
    
    <p>Psychology Today published a research that examines the social influence of outfits. The team found that we form strong opinions about other humans based on their attire in the first 3 seconds of meeting them.    One study proved that teachers had beliefs about children&rsquo;s academic ability based on their clothing.    Another proved that clothes can influence your concentration, negotiating skills, hormone levels and heart rate.</p>
    
    <p> Humans assign symbolic meanings to different types of clothes and then brains process that shit as reality. Brains are pretty much Mean Girls on steroids.   I know, it sounds depressing, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. &#8203;Edith Head said it best:      You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it.</p>
    
    <p> Clothes are the closest thing you have to wizardry. It is your vision board and a road map of your life to the rest of the world.</p>
    
    <p>You can wear clothes to raise your focus and you can wear clothes to make other people focus on you.</p>
    
    <p>Lawyers urge their defendants to carefully pick their attire for the jury. Often they hire a stylist to raise the odds of winning.</p>
    
    <p>Doctors use clothes to instill security in their patients. Mothers instinctually dress their offspring to look neater in hopes for a better, more organized future.</p>
    
    <p>Humans have been doing this for a while, fashion has symbiotically intertwined with our evolution. It means the world to us. So, why is fashions' power not widely recognized?</p>
    
    
    <h2> Fashion Conditioning</h2>
    
    <p>Fashion is not widely recognized as a power due to social conditioning.</p>
    
    <p>We are trained to believe that fashion is meaningless because it&rsquo;s easier to command people in uniforms. It&rsquo;s brainwashing and social herding, and it results in children growing up into adults that have behaviors, beliefs, actions, and emotions that have no logical motive or substantial evidence.</p>
    
    <p>What can help you innovate, aid your life is now used as an oppression tool. Fashion conditioning is stunting your progress and affects every facet of your life.</p>
    
    <h2>Fashion Stereotype</h2>
    
    <p>Breaking fashion conditioning, patterns and stereotypes that were set for you requires shifting your perspective. It takes effort and a bit of practice but once you master these skills you will be able to utilize the power of fashion with ease.</p>
    
    <p> First, you need to break any speck of illusion that fashion is meaningless in your head, because stereotypes distort reality.</p>
    
    <p> For eg. study after study has proved that when you tell a girl to focus on the fact that she is a girl and then give her a logical test she will do worse than she would if she focused on the fact that she is a good mathematician.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s not that girls are inherently bad at logic&rsquo;s tests, it's the propagated stereotype that glitches the brain and results in a bad performance.</p>
    
    <p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being done with fashion. The misconception that fashion equals to vanity is what stops you from questioning it, learning about it and from it.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s what allows modern slavery to still be a big part of the world and fashion industry. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing Earth to suffocate in front of your eyes. It&rsquo;s what allows child labour to still go on.</p>
    
    <p>Contrary to the popular belief, you can break the Orvelian grip that the industry holds on your right to personal expression. You can live in a world where child labour, modern slavery and fast fashion addictions are eradicated.</p>
    
    <p>Stop allowing others to limit and mold you. Remake yourself into a character you always wanted to be and then let's work on tossing out the shackles fashion industry has on our world.</p>
    
    <p>Let&rsquo;s stand on the right side of history.</p>
    
    <p>The best-dressed army is needed more than ever. We must fight, because to the rest of the world, the war is invisible, and will be until it&rsquo;s over&#8230;</p>
    
    <p>Though, history loves winners.</p>
