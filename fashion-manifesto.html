                <p>For example, I assume you're curious. I assume you wear clothing and might have had some
                        clothing-related thrills in your life. And I assume you're smart enough to get what this
                        manifesto is saying&#8230;</p>

                <p>Why did I say that? Just to be divisive?</p>
                <p> No, what I&rsquo;m saying is that the following text is not
                    exactly the <em>lightest</em>t read, but it&rsquo;s also worth reading.</p>
                <p> And so, without further ado, here is
                    the most concise version of the concept&#8230;</p>





                <div id="meaty">

                    <h2>The Fashionista in Danger Manifesto</h2>

                    <p>When I was a little girl, I used to <em>love</em> playing dress-up.</p>

                    <p>Cliche start, I know, but I&rsquo;m going somewhere with this; I used to build characters and
                        stories with my mom&rsquo;s clothing after digging through her closet. I would run off to
                        school, eager to show off my creative endeavours...</p>

                    <p>The kids didn&rsquo;t share my excitement. They found me <em>&ldquo;controversial&rdquo;</em> and
                        tried to
                        bully me into submission. There was always some &ldquo;good friend&rdquo; ready to explain to me
                        that <strong>&ldquo;sneakers don&rsquo;t belong with a dress&rdquo; </strong>ðŸ™„.</p>

                    <p> I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
                    <p>I wore what I wanted and cried myself to sleep.</p>

                    <p>I couldn&rsquo;t embrace my love for fashion the way I wanted to and at the same time, I
                        couldn&rsquo;t just let it go. Without being able to put my finger on it, I knew there was
                        something important there. Without getting <em>too</em> cheesy; it felt <em>magical</em>...</p>

                    <p>Let&rsquo;s skip ahead a few years;</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m older and (somewhat) wiser; liking fashion is
                        something I&rsquo;ve learned to be proud of, haters be damned. I shrug off associated terms like
                        &ldquo;ditzy&rdquo; and &ldquo;vain&rdquo; and just accept that it&rsquo;ll always be my little
                        guilty pleasure, like &ldquo;Reality TV&rdquo; is for some people or something...</p>

                    <p>I thought I had it all figured out, but then I watched a movie;</p>
                    <p>The Devil Wears Prada, if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, is a comedy-drama starring Meryl Streep as a
                        fashion magazine editor and
                        Anne Hathaway as the eager-to-prove-herself new hire.</p>

                    <p>A pretty standard fun-yet-tropey Y2K flick, but, it also contains a legendary monologue. It goes
                        something like this;</p>

                            <p>Miranda Priestly: Something funny?</p>
                            <p>Andy Sachs: No, no, nothing.
                                Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.
                                Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m still learning about all this
                                stuff.</p>
                            <p>Miranda Priestly:This &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;? Oh, okay. I see.<br> You think this has
                                nothing
                                to do with you.
                            <p>You go to your closet and you select out, oh I don&rsquo;t know, that lumpy blue
                                sweater, for instance, because you&rsquo;re trying to tell the world that you take
                                yourself too
                                seriously to care about what you put on your back. </p>
                            <p>But what you don&rsquo;t know is that that
                                sweater is not just blue, it&rsquo;s not turquoise, it&rsquo;s not lapis, it&rsquo;s
                                actually
                                cerulean. You&rsquo;re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
                                did a
                                collection of cerulean gowns.</p>
                            <p>And then I think it was Yves St Laurent, wasn&rsquo;t it, who
                                showed cerulean military jackets? And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections
                                of
                                eight different designers. </p>
                            <p>Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled
                                on down into some tragic &ldquo;casual corner&rdquo; where you, no doubt, fished it out
                                of some
                                clearance bin.</p>
                            <p> However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and so
                                it&rsquo;s sort of comical how you think that you&rsquo;ve made a choice that exempts
                                you from
                                the fashion industry when, in fact, you&rsquo;re wearing the sweater that was selected
                                for you
                                by the people in this room.</p>
                            <p> From a pile of &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo;</p>

                            </div>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                   <p>When I first saw that scene, I forgot to breathe.</p>

                    <p>It was like this new train of thought went deep into my being, tossing aside layers that had been
                        accumulated over the years and <em>expertly</em> flipped a switch.</p>

                    <p>That feeling that I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on before?</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Finger. On.</em></strong><em> Like a domino effect,</em> <em>the spark</em> went through all the previously ineffable thoughts
                        and connected them methodically into a network of understanding.</p>

                    <p>Here&rsquo;s what I understood;</p>
                    
                    <p>I &#8203;wasn&rsquo;t &#8203;into fashion because I was
                        &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; or &ldquo;silly&rdquo;. I felt drawn to it because I
                        sensed power; something through which to express and affect.</p><p> Because it was relatively
                        unexplored, it lacked the social credibility that other similarly powerful topics had. That is
                        the conflict that I had felt until that point; feeling connected to a power that the world
                        around me didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

                    <h2>Window to your Subconsciousness</h2>

                    <p>Go to your closet right now and have a look;</p>

                    <div class="indentText">
                    <p> There&rsquo;s clothing that you used to wear but
                        won't throw away, and that&rsquo;s who you were.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s clothing that you&rsquo;re not
                        fit for yet or you're saving for specific circumstances, and that&rsquo;s who you want to be
                        <em>(excluding clothing you haven&rsquo;t dared buy yet)</em>.</p>
                        
                    </div>        
                        <p>Then there&rsquo;s the vast and complex
                        interplay between who you want to be and who the world is pushing you to be, and that's the
                        clothing you wear every day.</p>
                     

                    <p>Apart from a few contrarians that refuse to play along, this should ring a bell with <em>most</em> of
                        you&#8230;</p>
                        <p> Depending on how deeply you dig into the why, you&rsquo;ll get some truths about
                        yourself. The results you get there are akin to what you might organically develop from things
                        like introspective meditation or a good therapy session.</p>

                    <p>We spend <em>billions</em> on therapy and books to help us understand ourselves better yet no one thought
                        to ask us how we feel about something we put on our bodies <em>every.single.day.</em></p>

                    <p>Clothing is all around us; <em>literally</em>. Wearing clothes is so entwined with our evolution that
                        it&rsquo;s the reason we don&rsquo;t have fur like our hairy ancestors&#8230;</p>

                    <p>Speaking of hairy ancestors; if you asked my Dad what his position in the fashion world is, he
                        would tell you that he&rsquo;s not &#8203;in &#8203;the fashion world. </p><p>But the thing is, just by
                        choosing to &ldquo;abstain&rdquo; from fashionable choices, he is &#8203;making &#8203;a fashion
                        choice. He is dressing to tell the world that <em>he doesn&rsquo;t care</em>.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s inescapable, to say the least. It permeates every facet of society; influences
                        everything from how <em>you</em> feel, to what others think and finds itself everywhere, from boardrooms
                        to changing rooms.</p><h2>Don&rsquo;t believe me?</h2>

                    <p> Well, think about it this way; clothing is all about <em>your</em> decisions, about how you want to
                        <em>represent yourself</em>. Your expression, your strategy, your first line of defence and the last bit
                        of armor you shred at the end of a hard day...</p>

                    <p><em>(the following are all sourced)</em></p>

                    <p>There&rsquo;s research that examines the social influence of fashion outfits; they&rsquo;ve found
                        that people develop a strong opinion about their fellow humans based on their attire in the
                        first 3 seconds of meeting them. Plus they could discern things such as your socioeconomic
                        status, your political leanings, sociological attitudes etc.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another study proved that teachers formed beliefs about
                        children&rsquo;s academic ability based on their clothing, while several studies proved that
                        clothes can influence your concentration, negotiation skills, even your hormone levels and heart
                        rate.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Did you know that lawyers often hire stylists to carefully attire their clients in regards
                        to the jury in order to raise their odds of winning? </p>

                        <p>You can wear clothes to raise your focus or make other people focus on you&#8230;</p>

                        <p>You know that billion dollar self-development industry I
                        mentioned before?</p>
                        <p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s nothing compared to the amount of money spent on drugs,
                        shrinks, behavioural/cognitive exercises, motivational books and courses, meetings and seminars
                        and all the other things people do to try to change the way they are...</p>

                    <p>This is all barely scratching the surface, but the point is that fashion impacts, like, a lot.
                    </p>

                    <p> Yet rarely do people utilize this ubiquitous aspect of reality, and if they do, rarely is it
                        used to potential. And no, I&rsquo;m not just talking about wearing an oversized sweater to feel
                        comfy.</p>
                        <p><strong>What am <em>I</em> trying to say here then?</strong></p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s time to start taking
                        fashion <em>seriously</em>;</p>
                        <p>If you think it&rsquo;s <em>silly</em> to take it <em>seriously</em>, well, let me tell you;
                        <em>your</em> thoughts might be less yours than you think&#8230;</p>
                        <p>Almost as if somebody has a vested interest in you not paying attention.</p><p> The misconception that fashion equals vanity is what
                        exacerbates the public&rsquo;s general lack of &ldquo;serious&rdquo; consideration and is part
                        of a deftly woven tapestry of factors that allow things such as <strong>modern slavery</strong> to still be a big
                        part of the fashion industry, along with actions that suffocate the Earth environmentally and
                        propagate <strong>child labour.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>By now, if you&rsquo;re not the Fashionista-type, you might be thinking,
                        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just abstain&rdquo;, but remember the story about my father? How there&rsquo;s
                        no real way to escape making &ldquo;fashion choices&rdquo;?</p><p> While you&rsquo;ve been asleep,
                        there&rsquo;s been a war raging in the background, and the bad guys have been winning, by a <em>lot.</em></p>
                        <p>Every time somebody makes the manipulated decision to choose Fast Fashion and in turn, support
                        the horrible system <em>behind</em> it, the <em>enemy</em> is winning the war. </p>
                        
                        <p>Whenever there&rsquo;s a young
                        person being stunted in their fashion exploration due to archaic notions of gender,
                        there&rsquo;s a budding <em>fashionista in danger...</em> </p>
                        
                        <p>Every step <em>against</em> fashion as a form of free expression is a move <em>against</em> humanity. In an ideal world, men don&rsquo;t have to melt in their
                        mono-chromatic suits because of &ldquo;office decorum&rdquo; and women don&rsquo;t have to shop
                        in the men&rsquo;s section for goddamn pockets&#8230;</p>
                        
                        <p> You shape the world around you through
                        your fashion choices, and mold <em>yourself</em> into what <em>you</em> want to be. It&rsquo;s time to take
                        Fashion seriously, or it will <em>seriously</em> fuck us up. </p>
                        
                        <p>Some might say that a society&rsquo;s
                        relationship with fashion could be a good indicator of how developed they are on social and
                        civil issues; after all, if you&rsquo;re being forced to wear something, the rest of your day is
                        not likely to be filled with freedom. </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What I&rsquo;m proposing here is this;</strong></p>
                        <p>Fashion should not
                        be just the indicator but rather also the gear with which we shift our development. (This
                        proposal is something I will return to and expand upon further in the future&#8230;) And with
                        that proposal, I conclude this &ldquo;mini&rdquo;manifesto of sorts. </p>
                        
                        <p>This Manifesto is incomplete, and will remain as such until there is no longer a need for it in the world. This
                        entire website is an extension of this manifesto; every post is a look at the world as seen
                        through the <a style="color:black; font-weight: 400;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fashionista in Danger">FiD*</a>.</p>
                        <p>Also, if you want to read about how <a style="color:black; font-weight: 400;"href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fashionista in Danger">FiD*</a> lense.</p> <p>
                        <p>Collectively, it&rsquo;ll become an industry watchdog and contain a
                        plethora of pieces that highlight brutalities committed using weaponized fashion. </p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;ll
                        also be a love letter to fashion and fashionista&rsquo;s and an aggregator of inspiration.
                        It&rsquo;ll be a wiki-of-sorts and a call to arms; a tool for self-development and, one day, a
                        passionate community, ready to organize and strike back against those who endanger fashion.</p>
