                    <p><em><small>Fashion Folklore is a series of interviews where real people unpack how Fashion impacts their life. This is Julie's story.</small></em></p>
                    <p ><strong>Have you ever been told you&rsquo;re too young to feel a certain way?</strong>
                    </p>
                 
                    <p >At age 20, Julie knew she needed a fresh start. How do you explain to your parents, your friends, anybody really, that there&rsquo;s nothing <em>wrong</em> per se; it&rsquo;s just not what <em>you</em> want.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <img src="img/support/julie.jpg" alt="Australian field girl walking" class="supportImage centerImageNews"/>
                
                    </div>
                 
                    <p >Growing up in a small town in Western Australia, Julie struggled to put a finger on what exactly it was she was looking for, but there were two things she knew for sure;</p>
                 
                    <div class="indentText">

                            <p >1. She would know what it was when she found it</p>
                
                            <p >2. She would <em>not</em> find it staying put</p>
           </div>
                 
                    <p >Julie tells me all this over coffee and cake and goes on to say how she moved to the city and this is what I imagined;</p>
                    <p >She has on Cat Eye &lsquo;sunnies&rsquo; and a red scarf as the wind is playfully wafting through her hair and she rides into town in her vintage convertible&hellip; turns out she came in on a bus.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <img src="img/support/flower-fields.jpg" alt="Australian field" class="supportImage centerImageNews"/>
                
                    </div>

                    <p >Visually, maybe not as impressive, but the vibe was there. She was ready for her fresh start.</p>
                 
                    <p >Her relationship with clothing was, as usual, symbolic of her overall issues; she wore clothes, of course, she wasn&rsquo;t a maniac or anything, but she didn&rsquo;t exactly go gaga when it came to garment shopping.</p> 
                    <p>For example, 10-year-old Julie would frequently go shopping with her grandma in thrift stores&hellip; stores that were filled with abandoned clothing nobody found interesting, so why would she? - she thought.</p>
                 
                    <p >Her early relationship with Fashion was tattered. For a long time, if asked about what she thought about Fashion, she would tell you she <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> think about Fashion; she wore clothes for practical reasons.</p>
                        
                    <p>She wore clothes to fit in, and her style reflected that - monochrome outfits with the express mission of blending in with the crowd.</p>
                 
                    <p >I&rsquo;m going to share something with you now (with Julie&rsquo;s permission of course) that has obviously impacted our protagonist&rsquo;s perception throughout her life; Julie was diagnosed with autism at a young age. A very common symptom of autism is a lack of expression, especially without the proper motivation to express.</p>
                 
                    <p >She made this big move in search of, well, herself, and after getting there and looking, and I mean <em>really</em> looking, she found nothing. Nothing that constituted an answer, at least. She found a bunch more thrift stores, but we&rsquo;ve already covered how she felt about those.</p>
                 
                    <p >The light at the end of the tunnel started sounding like lore.</p>
                 
                    <p >After going through a grey, bland hell and putting all her hopes on the most logical solution, Julie was getting desperate. This wasn&rsquo;t a matter of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this job&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this city&rdquo;; it was quickly becoming a matter of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this <em>life</em>."</p>
                 
                    <p >Julie was smart about it; she sought help. A series of positive interactions with &ldquo;Doctors covered in Stickers&rdquo; throughout her childhood taught her that hospitals are filled with people who care.</p>
                 
                    <p >Putting on a brave face for a long time can lead to forgetting what you look like, and it&rsquo;s not an easy process remembering. Nobody tells you how painful finding yourself is; no <em>wonder</em> people fake it.</p>
                 
                    <p >With the help of healthcare professionals, Julie was reborn. It was then and there that she decided to study psychology and build a career helping people going through similarly unexplored terrain.</p>
                 
                    <p >With a new lease on life, Julie was feeling <em>good</em>. Sadly, it was around this time in her life that her grandmother passed away. To celebrate her life, Julie decided to visit a thrift store, for old times&rsquo; sake.</p>
                 
                    <p >She walked through the doors of a thrift store and, expecting a familiar mish-mash of uninteresting garments to peruse while thinking of her grandma, she was instead surprised to find things, well, <em>interesting</em>.</p>
                 
                    <div class="row">
                        <img src="img/folklore/julie-treasure.jpg" alt="Australian field" class="supportImage centerImageNews"/>
                <p><small>"A zimmermann floral dress, which is my very favourite find, and which I only occasionally wear, because I don't want to wear it out and a little stone on a chain, because it's just so sweet." - Julie on her favorite thrifts.</small></p>
                    </div>

                    <p >It wasn&rsquo;t clothing nobody wanted anymore; it was the past, future and present all muddled up as it trickled down into this color-coded archive for like, <em>anybody</em> to just pick and choose from.</p>
                 
                    <p >For the first time in a thrift store, Julie really <em>saw</em> the clothing.</p>
                    <p >Instead of using garments practically to blend herself into the crowd, she started expressing herself through clothing.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <img src="img/folklore/julie.jpg" alt="thrift" class="supportImage centerImageNews"/>
                <p><small>"A high quality homemade Tudor-era Cardinal costume. May be one of my favourite finds ever. I've never even worn it, as it's for a large man. But I just love it and think it's beautiful." - Julie on her favorite thrifts.</small></p>
                    </div>
                 
                    <p >Remember how she felt about thrift stores when she was younger? In her own words, she now calls it &ldquo;Treasure Hunting&rdquo;. Grandma would be proud.</p>
                 
                    <p >In my hubris, I asked her &ldquo;Do you think people see you differently now that you have found yourself?&rdquo;</p>
                 
                    <p >Her response tied it all together perfectly;</p>
                 
                    <p >&ldquo;I have no idea. My condition doesn&rsquo;t allow me to read people&rsquo;s faces, all I know is that I love this. It&rsquo;s what allows me to explore every bit of me. That&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p>
